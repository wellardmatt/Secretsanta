He ensures that the work he does is in line with what student is doing at school by reviewing test results and workbooks and identifying where the student needs most support.

To whom it may concern.

Matthew has been working as a maths tutor to my son for several months. He is always
punctual and reliable, arriving in plenty of time to begin the lesson and often extends the
session to ensure that my son has completely understood.
He is very personable and relates well to my son. His patience and clear explanations have
helped to boost my son’s confidence and understanding of the subject. He demonstrates a real
enthusiasm for the subject and is able to relay this enthusiasm to my son.
Matthew comes well prepared for the lessons, ensuring that the topics he covers are in line
with those covered at college. He reviews the progress made and is able to identify the areas
where my son needs most support, spending time researching the syllabus and exam
specifications to ensure his teaching is correctly focussed. He has helped my son to develop a
better understanding of the subject and to become more logical and structured in his studies.
Matthew’s calm, patient approach has ensured that my son is able to approach his exams with
more confidence and with a deeper understanding of the subject.
I have no hesitation in recommending Matthew for employment.

Yours faithfully,

K. A. Dixon
