			<h4>About me:</h4>
		<p>I am an experienced A-level, GCSE, 13+ and 11+ Maths Tutor, having had over 50 tutees over the past 8 years and tutored for Reading University. I have a degree in Mathematics from The University of Nottingham, 2005.</p>
<p>
I am currently taking bookings for my Online A-level Easter Revision courses (click <a href="TempEnquiryForm.html">here</a> to book) and also have available tuition sessions for new students who need help achieving their summer grades or simply to develop their mathematical literacy.
			<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">(<span style=" text-decoration: underline;">I can sometimes offer face-to-face sessions if I have the time. If you are interested in this and within a 10 mile radius of Sandhurst please contact me via the booking page <a href="TempEnquiryForm.html" targert="_blank">here</a>.</span>)</p></p>
<p>
I have had experience and great success working with both struggling students and highly skilled students at all levels, and am very skilled at adjusting my tuition to the needs of each student, which has led to great improvements in their final exam results.

			</p><br><br>
			<h4>About my experience:</h4>
			<p>
			My experience has ranged from short term tuition helping students with their exam preparation to long term sessions that offer additional support alongside the student's current studies at school, college or university. In these longer sessions we have built up a comprehensive understanding of the work they are doing on their course, and filled any holes in knowledge we have found along the way.</p>

<h4>About my methods:</h4>
<p>
I believe in guided teaching. I ask leading questions so that the pupil starts to practice their own framework for thinking through a problem themselves. My teaching method involves a mix of discussion on a topic; explanation and reasoning, followed by examples and reference back to our initial discussion. In any exam situation, and indeed for long term knowledge retention, the best way to be able to manipulate a concept and solve mathematical problems is to have a full understanding of the processes you are using and why they work.</p>
